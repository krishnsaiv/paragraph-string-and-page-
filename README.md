 Step 1: Split the paragraph into words
 Step 2: Initialize variables for left and right-justified lines
 Step 3: Initialize variables to track the current line
 Step 4: Iterate through each word in the paragraph
 Step 5: Check if adding the current word exceeds the page width
         If it exceeds, justify the current line and reset variables
         If it doesn't exceed, add the word to the current line
 Step 6: Justify the last line
 Step 7: Return the arrays of left and right-justified lines
 Step 8: Print the results
